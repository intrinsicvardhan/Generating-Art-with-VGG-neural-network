# Generating-Art-with-VGG-neural-network
This is a python script that demonstrates how to use TensorFlow and Keras to train a deep learning model for image classification 

## Prerequisites
**Python 3.x**
<br/>
**TensorFlow 2.x**
<br/>
**Keras 2.x**
<br/>
**VGG Convolutional Neural Network: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keras/vgg19**

## Installation 
**1. Clone the repository:**
  `git clone` https://github.com/intrinsicvardhan/Generating-Art-with-VGG-neural-network.git
<br/>
**2. Change directory to the cloned repository:**
`cd https://github.com/intrinsicvardhan/Generating-Art-with-VGG-neural-network.git `
<br/>
**3. Install the required Python packages using pip:**
` pip install -r requirements.txt `
## Usage
**4. Modify the code to suit your specific use case, such as changing the model architecture, adjusting hyperparameters, or providing your own dataset.**
<br/>
**5. Run the script to train the model:**
`python train.py`
<br/>
**6. Once the model is trained, you can use it for prediction by loading the saved weights and making prediction on new data**
